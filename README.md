# Weather-Parameters-and-Heat-Index-Prediction-Applying-Deep-Neural-Networks
The project titled "Weather Parameters and Heat Index Prediction Applying Deep Neural Networks" focuses on forecasting key weather parameters such as dew point, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, as well as classifying the heat index level. A 10-year time series dataset was analyzed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for accurate weather parameter prediction, while Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used for heat index classification. The system achieved high performance with the LSTM model and 94.68% accuracy from the ANN-based heat index classification. Developed using Python in Google Colab, the project leverages libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn for data processing, model building, training, and evaluation.
